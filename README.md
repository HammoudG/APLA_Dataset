# APLA_Dataset

Data for the replication of the paper The Asylum Policies in Latin America (APLA) Database: Findings from an Expanded Methodology to Study Refugee Policies in Latin America, 1990-2018

The APLA_Paper in the vignette includes the replication code for all the graphs and charts of the paper. 

Data_APLA contains data that includes APLA's regulatory complexity and liberalisation scores, as well as a number of relevant variables that are used in further research. 

Data_APLA_1 and Data_APLA_Maps are slightly modified versions of the dataset above, which allows to better plot, map or chart certain variables. 

APLA Database.xlx is the original APLA Dataset. APLA Liberalisation and APLA Regulatory Complexity include the files where the calculation of the two dependent variables was conducted. 

Annex I includes the questionnaire used to codify APLA. 
Annex II includes the Codebook with the Rules for the codification. 
Annex III presents a series of maps with the major policy measures adopted over time in each country.
